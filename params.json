{"name":"DarkUI","tagline":"Dark themed control and docking library for .NET WinForms.","body":"### About DarkUI.\r\nDarkUI is an attempt to create a simple, extensible control library which emulates the look and feel of popular tabbed document interfaces such as Visual Studio, Photoshop, WebStorm, and XCode. Originally just a collection of bug fixes and enhancements built on top of WinForms, it has now evolved in to a fully working docking and control library.\r\n\r\n### How to use.\r\nDarkUI is easy to use. It uses a mix of inherited control types (text box, button, label etc.) and a few completely custom additions (dock panel, list view, scrollbar etc.) If you've ever built a WinForms application before, you should be able to easily use DarkUI in exactly the same way.\r\n\r\nSimply download the latest version from GitHub and build it - the example application included shows how you can build a Visual Studio style tabbed interface within minutes.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots.\r\n[TBA]","google":"UA-27393933-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
